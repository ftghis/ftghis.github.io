I love to build scalable robust systems; specially in the areas of distributed systems and spatial computing. I am an exited entrepreneur in AR/AI and ex-tech lead at Amazon.
Selerio was a spin-out from Cambridge University to build Spatial AI for AR. We were VC-backed by the likes of GGV, Betaworks, EF and later got acquired by Streem. Now, we are now part of FrontDoor (FTDR), laying the foundations of XR for home services.

At AWS, I was a tech lead on the AWSHealth service; from its inception to its public release at Re-Invent 2016. AWS Health provides ongoing visibility into your resource performance and the availability of your AWS services and accounts.
